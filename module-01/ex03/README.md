### Use pointers:

- When you need to dynamically allocate memory.
- When you need to null the pointer to indicate the absence of an object.
- When you need to use pointer arithmetic.
- When you need greater flexibility for manipulating memory.


---


### Use references:

- When you need to pass an argument to a function without making a copy.
- When you want to ensure that an object cannot be null.
- When you want clean and concise code.
- When you don't need to modify the object through the reference.


- In ex03 we use pointers so we can check for NULL
